                    <p>Hi, I'm Dandy. 👋</p>
                    <p>I've been on and off Chatango since 2007. Also, shoutout to <a href="https://nightdew.chatango.com/" target="_blank">Nightdew</a> for introducing me to this community all those years ago. We played ToonTown Online together (great game, btw) and wanted a place to talk without dealing with the in-game censorship.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I'm a dork who loves heavy metal, bad '80s movies, and all-you-can-eat buffets. I look a lot like John Lennon, but my talent is (unfortunately) in IT engineering instead of music. And John McAfee is my role model.</p>
                    <p>I'm the lead developer of <a href="https://yap.chatango.com/" target="_blank">Yap</a>, a lovable chat bot who's consumed too much brainrot content. I'm also the owner of <a href="https://chapel.chatango.com/" target="_blank">Chapel</a>, which is <b>not</b> a harem btw. Oh, and you can find me in <a href="https://epic.chatango.com/" target="_blank">Epic</a> or <a href="https://jewelisland.chatango.com/" target="_blank">Jewel Island</a> from time to time, too.</p>
