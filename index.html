Also, shoutout to <a href=https://nightdew.chatango.com/ target=_blank>Nightdew</a> for introducing me to this community all those years ago. We played ToonTown Online together (great game, btw) and wanted a place to talk without dealing with the in-game censorship.<p>Anyway, I'm a dork who loves heavy metal, bad '80s movies, and all-you-can-eat buffets. I look a lot like John Lennon, but my talent is (unfortunately) in IT engineering instead of music. And John McAfee is my role model.<p>I'm the lead developer of <a href=https://yap.chatango.com/ target=_blank>Yap</a>, a lovable chat bot who's consumed too much brainrot content. I'm also the owner of <a href=https://chapel.chatango.com/ target=_blank>Chapel</a>, which is <b>not</b> a harem btw. Oh, and you can find me in <a href=https://epic.chatango.com/ target=_blank>Epic</a> or <a href=https://jewelisland.chatango.com/ target=_blank>Jewel Island</a> from time to time, too.</div></div></section></div>
